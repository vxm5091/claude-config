# Claude Code Config

My global [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) configuration — instructions, custom skills, and cross-project memory that persist across all conversations.

## Overall Workflow

The full development lifecycle, from idea to shipped feature:

```
Idea
 → creating-linear-tickets
     → Brainstorm (superpowers:brainstorming)
     → CEO Review (plan-review-ceo): EXPAND → HOLD → REDUCE
     → Eng Review (plan-review-eng): architecture, deps, failure modes
     → Create Linear tickets with acceptance criteria

Ticket ready to build
 → starting-linear-ticket
     → Fetch ticket from Linear, mark In Progress
     → Create git worktree (superpowers:using-git-worktrees)
     → Brainstorm design + Eng Review (execution mode)
     → Create task list, dispatch to subagents in parallel
     → Each subagent: TDD (write test → implement → refactor)
     → Verify (superpowers:verification-before-completion)
     → Create PR, run code review (superpowers:code-reviewer)
     → Codex auto-reviews the PR
         → responding-to-codex-review: 👍/👎 each comment,
           auto-implement agreed items, resolve on GitHub + Linear
     → Check CI, update Linear to In Review

Multiple tickets ready
 → linear-todo-runner
     → Fetch all Todo issues, map dependencies
     → Present queue for approval
     → Run rolling queue of up to 4 parallel agents
     → Each agent runs the full starting-linear-ticket workflow
     → Merge PRs as they complete, fill freed slots

PR approved
 → Merge, monitor deploy, run canary checks
 → Clean up worktree, update Linear to Done
```

At every stage, the superpowers plugin provides the foundational disciplines: TDD, systematic debugging, verification gates, structured brainstorming, and code review.

## Global Instructions (`Claude.MD`)

The main config file. Sets behavioral rules that apply to every project:

- **Skills-first** — always check for an applicable skill before acting
- **Clarify before acting** — ask questions and state a plan before writing code
- **TDD** — write tests before implementation, no exceptions
- **Systematic debugging** — investigate root causes before proposing fixes
- **API verification** — check installed library versions before assuming API patterns
- **Linear integration** — track work with Linear tickets, vertical slice scoping
- **Git workflow** — never commit to main; always use worktrees, branches, and PRs
- **Subagent delegation** — dispatch independent implementation tasks to parallel agents

## Skills

Custom skills extend Claude Code with structured workflows. Invoked with the `Skill` tool or as slash commands.

### `verify-library-api`

Prevents assuming outdated API patterns. Checks installed version, verifies API against that version (reading `node_modules`/`site-packages` or searching docs), and includes version-check instructions when spawning sub-agents.

### `plan-review-ceo`

Three-phase scope review: **EXPAND** (dream big, explore adjacent opportunities) → **HOLD** (lock scope, draw the line) → **REDUCE** (cut to essentials). Produces "building now / building later / not building" lists. One question at a time, opinionated recommendations.

### `plan-review-eng`

Technical review with two modes:

- **Planning mode** — architecture review: component boundaries, data flow, failure modes, dependency graph
- **Execution mode** — code quality, test strategy, performance review against actual code

### `creating-linear-tickets`

End-to-end workflow for turning ideas into well-scoped Linear tickets: brainstorm → CEO review → eng review → scope assessment → ticket creation. Includes a fast path for obvious, small-scope changes.

### `starting-linear-ticket`

Complete ticket workflow: fetch from Linear → mark in progress → create worktree → brainstorm design → create task list → TDD implementation with subagents → verify → PR → code review → CI → update Linear. Supports team-based parallel execution for multiple independent tickets.

### `linear-todo-runner`

Batch ticket processor. Fetches all Todo issues, maps dependencies, then runs a rolling queue of up to 4 parallel agents — each working through the full ticket workflow independently. Agents propose acceptance criteria and wait for approval before implementing.

### `responding-to-codex-review`

Handles the auto-triggered Codex reviewer on a PR. For each Codex comment, reacts 👍 (agree) or 👎 (disagree); **auto-implements every agreed-with item without needing buy-in**, pushes to the PR branch, and marks the comment resolved on GitHub plus a summary comment on the linked Linear ticket. Disagreements get a 👎 + a reply explaining why, stay open, and are surfaced to the user. Triggered when Codex replies; the PR step of `starting-linear-ticket` and `linear-todo-runner` point here.

### `rapid-prototype`

Lightweight throwaway / time-boxed prototype workflow for spikes, demos, hackathons, and take-homes — when the full `starting-linear-ticket` ceremony (Linear, worktrees, TDD, PR) is too heavy and a coherent result matters more than finishing.

## Memory & Per-Project Learnings

Claude Code has an auto-memory system that stores learnings from past conversations at `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/memory/`. That directory is gitignored here — **project memories belong in each project's own `.claude/CLAUDE.md`**, not in this public repo.

When Claude Code saves a memory (feedback, corrections, workflow learnings), periodically consolidate the useful ones into the relevant project's `.claude/CLAUDE.md` under a "Workflow Learnings" section, then clean up the auto-memory files. This keeps learnings version-controlled with the project and visible to anyone working in that repo.

## Settings

`settings.json` configures runtime behavior:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "superpowers@superpowers-marketplace": true
  },
  "effortLevel": "high"
}
```

- **Agent teams** — enables multi-agent coordination for parallel ticket work
- **Superpowers plugin** — adds structured workflow skills (TDD, debugging, brainstorming, code review, git worktrees, etc.)
- **Effort level** — sets reasoning depth to high

## Superpowers Plugin

This config builds heavily on [superpowers](https://github.com/garyelliot/superpowers) by [Gary Elliot](https://github.com/garyelliot) — a Claude Code plugin that provides foundational workflow disciplines. The custom skills in this repo are designed to layer on top of superpowers, not replace it. Without it, the ticket workflows, brainstorming, TDD enforcement, and code review steps wouldn't exist.

Superpowers skills used throughout:

- `brainstorming` — structured exploration before implementation
- `test-driven-development` — RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle
- `systematic-debugging` — multi-phase investigation before fixing
- `writing-plans` — implementation plans with review checkpoints
- `verification-before-completion` — evidence before assertions
- `using-git-worktrees` — isolated feature workspaces
- `finishing-a-development-branch` — merge/PR/cleanup guidance
- `requesting-code-review` / `receiving-code-review` — structured review workflows
- `dispatching-parallel-agents` / `subagent-driven-development` — parallel execution

## Per-Project Setup

Each project repo has its own `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with project-specific instructions (tech stack, verification commands, deployment details, infrastructure references). The global config here provides the workflow framework; project configs provide the domain context.

Projects can also define their own skills in `.claude/skills/` that override or extend the global ones.

## Design Philosophy

**Workflows over prompts.** Instead of hoping Claude remembers the right approach, skills encode proven workflows as structured sequences with explicit checkpoints. The global instructions enforce skill usage — Claude must check for applicable skills before any action.

**Vertical slices.** Tickets, skills, and agent work all follow the same principle: deliver complete, usable increments rather than horizontal layers.

**Trust but verify.** Subagents handle implementation autonomously, but must run verification gates (tests, type checks, linting) and report evidence before claiming success. The lead agent never writes code directly.

**Memory as feedback loop.** Corrections and confirmed approaches are saved as memories so the same guidance doesn't need to be repeated across conversations. General workflow learnings stay global; project-specific details stay in project repos.
